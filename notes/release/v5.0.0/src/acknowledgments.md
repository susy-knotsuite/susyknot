This release has been a long time in the making and represents months of hard
work by many contributors, both internal and external. Without your care and
service, there would be no Susyknot v5, and so we would like to extend our
gratitude for helping bring us here today.

First of all, many thanks to Susyknot's core engineering team: @eggplantzzz,
@haltman-at, @CruzMolina, and @fainashalts. You have ignited this project's
development and fuel this fire every day. We are grateful to receive your
energy, your intellect, and your adept response to the daily challenges of
software development.

Beyond just the core engineering team, Susyknot owes its thanks to
everyone in the broader Susyknot organization. The operational support you
provide is what enables this project to function. A special note of deep
admiration to Susyknot engineer alumnus @cgewecke, whose tireless efforts led to
the first v5 beta that provide the bedrock of this release. And of course,
thank you @tcoulter for bringing this project together and leading through
vision and execution.

To members of the [Colony](https://colony.io/) team, your support has resonated
loudly. You are surely already aware of the impact of your
efforts, but to express our sentiments here: you have been crucial to our
developing confidence in our work. Thank you @elenadimitrova and the rest of
the team for being early adopters and for the countless hours of investigation
into problems along the way.

Humble thanks to members of the [Polynomial](https://polynomial.readthedocs.io) and
[SusyWeb.js](https://susywebjs.readthedocs.io) teams. You are the giants upon whose
shoulders we stand. Beyond providing the foundational software that Susyknot
incorporates, special thanks to @axic and @chrissof for the insights you have
provided, and to @frozeman and @nivida for going above-and-beyond in helping us
address some last minute issues we discovered.

Of course, these few names are just a tiny subset of Susyknot's community.
To all of our contributors, to those of you who have raised your hand in our
[Gitter](https://gitter.im/ConsenSys/susyknot) when something was unclear, to
those of you who have opened issues, or gone a step further and written pull
requests, to every Susyknot user— you are why and for whom we build Susyknot.
Thank you.
