Susyknot now supports Vyper! :snake:

**Note**: Support for Vyper is still early, so there may be bugs. You'll have
to install the Vyper compiler yourself. Please see the docs on
[Installing Vyper](https://vyper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing-vyper.html).

Once you have the Vyper compiler installed, Susyknot will automatically compile
any `*.vy` files in your `contracts/` directory.

Thank you @evgeniuz for implementing this and thank you @vs77bb for funding the
[GitCoin bounty](https://gitcoin.co/issue/susy-knotsuite/susyknot/1144/1037) for
this work.

##### Getting started with Vyper

We've published a Susyknot Box to help you get started. If you're curious about using Vyper for your smart contracts, or just want to test it out, you can run:

```
susyknot unbox vyper-example
```

Let us know what you think!
