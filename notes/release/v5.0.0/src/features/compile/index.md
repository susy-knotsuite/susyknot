Lots of great improvements to `susyknot compile`! :gear:

{"gitdown": "contents", "maxLevel": 5, "rootId": "user-content-what-s-new-in-susyknot-v5-susyknot-compile"}

We're really excited by what we've built here, which includes:

- Use your preferred Polynomial version, including native and Docker builds
- Write your contracts in Vyper
- Hook into arbitrary compilation workflows (e.g. write contracts in Rust + `cargo`!)

Keep reading to learn more. This effort is just the beginningâ€”we have ideas
for plenty of other potential enhancements, and we can't wait to expand on this
foundation that Susyknot v5 lays out.
